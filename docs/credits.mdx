## How do Kadoa credits work?

Here is the breakdown of all costs associated with a data workflow:

### Standard Mode

| Action                       | Cost          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Minimum charge per run       | 100 credits   |
| Extracting a data row        | 1 credit      |
| Extracting a details page    | 10 credits    |

For example, if your workflow extracts 20 data rows and their detail pages, the total cost for one run would be:

> 20 (rows) * 10 (credits per detail page) = 200 credits

If you extract 50 rows without detail pages:

> 50 (rows) * 1 (credit per row) = 50 credits

However, since the total is less than the base cost, you'll be charged the minimum of 100 credits.

### Adhoc Mode

Adhoc mode is only available over API

| Action                                                 | Cost          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Extracting a normal page                               | 50 credits    |
| Extracting a page with user-set location (countryCode) | 200 credits   |

Adhoc mode pricing is due to the more challenging nature and higher expenses associated with live data extraction.

## Do credits expire?

Yes, credits are valid for one billable month, leftovers are not rolled-over to the next month.

## What happens if a website can't be scraped?

We only charge for successful requests. If there should be any technical issues with a scraper, we'll investigate it as soon as possible.

## Do enterprise customers also get credits?

No, enterprise customers have custom usage commitments depending on their volume and update frequency.
