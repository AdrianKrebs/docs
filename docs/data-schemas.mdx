## What is a data schema?

Every workflow at Kadoa needs a data schema. It tells Kadoa:

-   what entity to look for in source data (such as products, jobs, news)
-   what fields to extract for the selected entity (such as title, price, description)

## How do I manage my data schemas?

Kadoa offers two ways to create and manage data schemas:
### 1. Create a custom schema from scratch

- [Create a new custom workflow](https://kadoa.com/add)
- Configure the workflow to extract the desired data
- Click the "..." menu of the workflow on the dashboard and select "Save as schema"
- Give your schema a name and description
- Your custom schema will be available on the [data schemas](https://kadoa.com/schemas) page

### 2. Customize a pre-defined schema

- Navigate to the [data schemas](https://kadoa.com/schemas) page on your dashboard
- Click "Add new data schema"
- Choose a pre-defined schema as a starting point, based on your use case (e.g., products, jobs, news)
- Customize the schema by adding, removing, or modifying fields
- Save your customized schema
- [Create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add) and select your customized schema

## Using pre-defined data schemas
Kadoa offers pre-defined schemas for common use cases.
These schemas come with a set of standard fields that Kadoa will extract, but you can still customize them based on your specific needs.

Currently available data schemas:
- [job postings](#job-postings-schema)
- [ecommerce products](#ecommerce-schema)
- [news articles](#news-article-schema)
