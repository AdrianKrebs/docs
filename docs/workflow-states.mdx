title: Workflow States
---

When you create a workflow in Kadoa, it goes through various states as it extracts and processes data from a website.
Here's a quick reference guide to help you understand what each state means:


| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| In Progress | The workflow is currently extracting data from the targeted website and is functioning as expected. |
| Finalizing | The workflow is in the final stages of processing the data. |
| Active | The workflow has completed the data extraction and the data is ready to access. |
| Paused | The workflow's operation is temporarily halted due to user action, lack of credits, or system-imposed pauses. |
| Sample Processing | Kadoa is processing sample data for free. You'll get an email when the data is ready for review. |
| Pending Review | Kadoa has prepared a free sample of your data. Please review and configure. |
| Support | The Kadoa team is investigating this workflow. |
| On Hold | The workflow has encountered a site or task it cannot currently process, possibly due to complexity or protection mechanisms. |
| Error | The workflow has encountered a technical error and the Kadoa team is proactively investigating this issue. |
