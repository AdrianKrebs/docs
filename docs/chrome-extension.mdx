## Single object vs. multiple objects

When you select a single object, Kadoa will treat the entire selection as a single element:

When you select multiple objects, the extracted data will contain a list of elements with identical structure:

## Compatibility

The Kadoa extension is compatible with recent versions of Google Chrome browser and Chromium-based browsers (Vivaldi, Brave, etc).

Safari and Firefox are currently not supported.

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not open.**

This is most likely because the webpage has not yet finished loading. Please reload the page and wait until it’s fully loaded.

**I cannot change anything on a webpage after I opened the Kadoa extension.**

Before clicking the Kadoa extension icon, make sure that the page has finished loading and all elements you want to select are visible (e.g. expand the collapsed areas, close any blocking popups, etc).

**I cannot select the element I need, it’s covered by nested elements.**

Select any nested element, then click ↖ icon to select its parent element.

**The page reloads after I close the Kadoa extension.**

This is an intended behavior. To make elements available for selection, Kadoa removes all event handlers from the page. To restore them, the page is reloaded.
