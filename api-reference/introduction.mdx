## Welcome
Kadoa is built as an API-first platform. Everything you can do on your Kadoa Dashboard is also possible with our flexible API.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"headers":  {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
}
```
